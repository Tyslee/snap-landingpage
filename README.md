## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size

### Links

- Live Site URL: [snap](https://snap-landingpage.vercel.app/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com//)
- [Preline](https://preline.co/index.html)

### What I learned

This project I mostly wanted to building something that I thought looked good while exploring different libraries and frameworks while making a more interactable site. I also wanted to build a single page webapp. Managing the height of the screen to be used by multiple divs proved the be a lot more challenging than I thought but happy I was able to do it in the end! And it looks great on desktop and on mobile!

### Continued development

This is a really fun project but is still relatively simple. I want to try doing more fancy projects and/or projects that require more backend.
